This is the data supplement for the manuscript:
This repository contains sequence alignments, trees, and python scripts used for analysis.


constraint_alignments_and_domain_IDs: This dir contains the constraint trees, and the fastas necessary for the AU comparison

dating: This contains all files relevant for the dating analysis

expanded alignments: this contains the various concatenates for the slow vs. fast/ number of markers test (cat1 and cat4 refer to IQTREE rate categories, 1 is slow, 4 is fast)

python scripts: this includes the python scripts needed to calculate AB stem, check monophyly, convert IQTREE rate files into fasta, total tree length, and the python script to write constraint trees (from a simple .tsv)

result_files: this contains the .csvs with all the results used for the paper, as well as the trees from the model/marker tests
